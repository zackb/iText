iText can view and manage the text messages and notes on your iPhone and perform backups to your mac. Since SMS messages and notes are the few things that Apple does not allow you to archive I figured we needed a solution.

Iâ€™d love to hear feedback from people. Note that this is a beta version. It is relatively stable but I want to see what people can dig up.
